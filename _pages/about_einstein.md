Greetings! ðŸŒŸ Namaste! ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³; Moi! ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡®

I'm Amarjeet Saini, and I thrive on building computer systems, diving into programming, and delving into the vast realms of AI and Embedded Systems. Currently pursuing my master's in Automation and Electrical Engineering at Aalto University, Finland, I've already conquered a bachelor's degree in ECE from the prestigious Army Institute of Technology, Pune. Presently calling Espoo, Finland my home, I balance the circuits with a dash of adrenaline through running, freeze moments with photography, and score victories in various sports.

This website stands as the intersection of my myriad pursuits ðŸš€
